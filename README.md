# repo-template
A _ready-to-use_ repo template based on the components (actions, plugins...) I find myself using most often.

Continuously updated, based on the components that I gradually find interesting.

Components currently included:
- [**<code>TDG</code> plugin**](https://github.com/ribtoks/tdg-github-action): I often add lots of <code>TODO</code> while coding, so... why not?
